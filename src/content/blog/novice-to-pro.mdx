# Introduction

As a Nigerian web developer, I’ve come to realize that failure is not something to be feared or hidden, but rather something to be embraced and learned from. In fact, I’ve come to understand that failure is merely a road to success.

My journey so far has been marked by mistakes, missteps, and moments of doubt, but it’s through these experiences that I’ve grown and learned the most. In this post, I’ll share some of the most significant mistakes I’ve made, what I learned from them, and how they’ve helped me become a better developer. If you’re a fellow developer or just starting out, I hope my experiences will help you achieve your goals faster.

Hi friends! I am a full-stack web developer. Though I’m just getting into the field, it feels like I’ve been in tech for the longest time. Starting out—whether in music or sports—often means you’re prone to mistakes. These mistakes have sometimes left me doubting whether tech is meant for me and have made me want to give up completely.

I didn’t realize this until a close friend advised me to build a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. The takeaway here is simple: you can always Google things. The best way to learn is to grasp the foundations and build something. No amount of theory can substitute for real experience.

## Chasing Paychecks Over Purpose

This is my biggest mistake overall—one that almost cost me my entire career.

After completing my learning phase, I felt ready to build complete websites. As I started hearing about how much others charged for their services, I felt pressured to raise my own prices dramatically, which ultimately scared away potential clients.

When I began learning web development, I had a reasonable price range in mind. However, hearing about exorbitant fees made me change my mentality. I turned down several deals that people were eager for.

While I believe in charging well for my work, it’s essential to recognize that those charging higher prices typically have years of experience, a solid reputation, and satisfied clients backing them up. A conversation with my brother opened my eyes: clients willing to
