## Introduction

People are more willing to listen if you talk with confidence as opposed to insecurity. You donâ€™t need to be a web developer to know this; in fact, the majority of people aware of this are entrepreneurs. Talking with confidence is more than 50% of what is taught in their coursesâ€”not just talking with confidence, but also convincing people. Personally, I have heard stories about how they are working with startups and have not started making money yet. It just breaks my heart.

## Success Rate of Startups in Nigeria

A report by Weetracker revealed that only 39% of startups in Nigeria survive within the first few years. Basically, in every 1,000 startups, only about 390 make it through the initial years. These stats are based on serious startups, not your everyday e-commerce guy. Because of this, investors are very careful about who they choose to provide funding for. Experts say investors are focusing on blockchain, artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and so on.

## My Experience

It was about 11 p.m., and my school was having a suya night. Just as I was leaving, I got a call from someone who initially asked if I could develop applications. I answered the call, and we exchanged pleasantries. He started talking about how he has a team consisting of a web graphics guy and the likes. Then, he opened up about how his web developer does not know how to build a proper e-commerce website and how he is struggling with payment issues, among other things. He mentioned that they had already bought a domain name. If Iâ€™m being honest, this was my first web client, though I had built a few other websites for free to get referrals, so I was genuinely happy. But that happiness was cut short when he said he could only pay for data for now and started going on about how his lawyer said it is okay to not have money while just starting because of something called sweat equityâ€”essentially telling me to work for free and that he would pay when "they don hammer." Luckily for me, my brother had warned me about people like this before, so I told him I would think about it and ended the call.

Later, around 8 p.m., my school was hosting a competition in different games like eFootball, indomie eating, chess, Naija whot, and more. I had just finished a game of whot when I got a group call on WhatsApp. I left the building and joined the call. On that call, the web guy and the graphics guy were also there, trying to convince me to join their team. At that moment, I realized that nothing would make me work for this guy for free. I thought to myself that I could either convince him to pay me or end the call right there. So, I tried to convince him because the worst that could happen was that heâ€™d end the call. I repeatedly told him that just as he has a business, I also have a business, and I would need to be paid to keep my business going. I offered to build it for 70,000 Naira, and after almost an hour on the call, he finally accepted.

Now think about this: he could pay me all this while, but he just wanted me to work for free for no sane reason. So, which was betterâ€”working for free or getting paid something, even if it was small, for an e-commerce website?

At this point, he had paid me my complete money. You would think it was over, right? He came back and said he would need someone to maintain the site, and I told him I could, but it would come at a cost. Knowing that he didnâ€™t have much in the business, I agreed to 50K every 30th, with the condition that after three months, we would renegotiate the salary. But I was surprised by the stuff this guy was requesting; he was looking for those subtle things that are extremely difficult to implement. I went through everything, and on the 30th, I messaged him, but all I got was big grammar and long stories. It dawned on me that I had just been tricked really bad.

So, I did what any responsible Nigerian web developer would doâ€”I took his site down and threatened him. The painful thing is that he was still claiming to be right, telling me that he wouldnâ€™t engage my services for now and that I should give him about three months to get the money.

## My Advice

At this point, I want to clarify that I am not saying there is anything wrong with working for a startup and not making a dime. Iâ€™m just saying that we should exercise caution and do our research before making any rash decisions. The truth of the matter is that a startup that is serious should have funding to pay for a web developer. Even if there is no money anywhere, as a web developer, you are the one offering help and investing in them, so you should make sure that you have 100% confidence that this business is going somewhere. Because the truth is that Nigeria is a jungle, and in the jungle, strength is not enough; true survival lies in the wisdom to navigate its challenges and understand the balance of power and patience.

## Conclusion

Being a web developer is not easy, but if it were easy, people wouldnâ€™t be making millions from web. Please, let's be cautious of who and what we choose to put our faith in, and remember that we are all more valuable than we know.
