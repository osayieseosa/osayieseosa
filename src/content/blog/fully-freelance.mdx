## Introduction

If you’ve read some of my blogs, you’ll realize that I haven’t been in tech for up to a year now. I am essentially documenting my journey as I navigate this path. My name is Eseosa Osayi, a full-stack web developer, and I recently decided to stop applying for 9-5 jobs—whether in Nigeria, abroad, remote, or on-site. Of course, I’m not saying I won’t change my mind later, but for now, this is my decision, and here’s why.

## My Experience Working a 9-5

About a month ago, I saw a post on Nairaland from someone looking for a web developer. Without hesitation, I copied the number and messaged the person. He asked if I was good with React, and I was thrilled because React is my main library. He then asked for my portfolio website, which I promptly shared. After about 10 minutes, I noticed I had been added to a group chat. Curious, I reached out to the guy and asked about the job. He explained that I’d be assisting the senior back-end developer with some basic tasks and mentioned the monthly pay. While the pay wasn’t bad for a part-time role, I felt I was being ripped off, especially since it was for a foreign company earning significantly more.

At that time, I was already working on a full-stack project for a client, so you can imagine how difficult it was to juggle everything. To make matters worse, they were using PHP, a language I’d never worked with, as I’ve always used MongoDB throughout my career. Fortunately, the team was open to questions, and I relied heavily on ChatGPT to navigate the challenges. Still, it was far from easy, especially when errors began popping up.

Eventually, I completed the first set of tasks and submitted them to the team’s GitHub repository at around 5 AM. Just a few hours later, at 8 AM, my phone rang. It was the guy from the team, but I didn’t pick up because I’m not a morning person. Checking the group chat, I saw there was an error in the code I had submitted. To be honest, most of it was ChatGPT’s work, and not knowing PHP, I had no idea where to start troubleshooting. I could have fixed it eventually, but to save both our time, I discussed it with him, and we decided to part ways.

But I didn’t quit because of the bug. I quit for several reasons:

- I prefer the front-end to the back-end.
- I wasn’t comfortable with the stack; I’m a firm believer that MongoDB is the way to go.
- I didn’t have enough time for side projects, like the full-stack project I was working on.
- I hated relying on ChatGPT for my entire code.

## Why Freelancing Works for Me

Looking back, I realized freelancing suits me better than a 9-5 job. With freelancing, you’re involved in every aspect of a project, from pitching to delivery. Even if you’re not fully motivated, you’re still aware of the project’s start-to-finish process. In contrast, a typical 9-5 job often makes you feel like just a cog in the machine—a bot executing tasks with little room for creativity. While I’m not trying to hate on regular jobs, this has been my personal experience.

Additionally, I’ve seen many people on Reddit complain that their jobs leave them with little time to pursue side projects, which takes the fun out of web development. For someone like me who thrives on side projects, that’s a dealbreaker. Lastly, freelancing offers time flexibility. I can do all my work in the morning and spend the rest of the day outdoors, which is incredibly important to me.

## Conclusion

I’m not sure if I’ll change my mind one day. Perhaps my current mindset is influenced by a lack of proper opportunities. But for now, I can safely say freelancing is the way to go for me.
