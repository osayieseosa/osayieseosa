## Introduction

I finally decided to visit the Benin City National Museum, considering it's so close to where I stay. The museum is located at the center of King’s Square. It was opened to the public in 1973 and is managed by the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), an agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria responsible for the preservation, promotion, and development of Nigeria’s cultural heritage. The museum has served as a custodian of Nigeria’s rich and diverse cultural legacy.

## Highlights of the Museum

I took a cab and arrived around 1 pm. We were asked to pay ₦200 for parking. As I got off, I noticed it was a bit difficult to find the entrance as a first-time visitor. I had expected the parking lot to be right in front of the museum. Luckily, I had seen a few pictures online, and I recognized the main building. Once I got there, I was directed by the security to the gallery. I had to pay ₦500 for the tour. I don’t know if it's standard practice, but I didn’t get a tour guide—it was just me walking around and learning about the artifacts. Fortunately, descriptions were provided for the exhibits.

### Bronze Head

As I navigated my way around the gallery, the first thing I noticed was the bronze head. According to the description, these were mainly used by the Oba for decoration and ritual purposes. The objects were made by specialist casters in a guild known as "Iguneromwon," who were commissioned to work for the king.

### Ancestral Altar

Personally, this was the most eye-catching and interesting piece in the gallery. However, it was the only piece without a description—perhaps it fell off and hadn’t been fixed. After doing some research, I found out that this is Oba Akenzua II’s ancestral altar. Normally, these altars are adorned with some of the finest examples of art from the Benin Kingdom. This one includes matched pairs of carved elephant tusks, reflecting the increasing value of ivory at the time. The cast-brass head, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum, has a natural look and a shiny surface, making it both beautiful and intimidating—qualities of a powerful monarch. These altars serve as a site through which a living leader communicates with his ancestors, known as "Enikaro" in Benin.

### Ogiuwu (Symbol of Death)

Ogiuwu was the chief in charge of all executioners. The presentation of this plaque to the accused symbolized a death sentence.

### The Ada and Eben (Ceremonial Sword)

No one truly knows how the Ada came about, but rumor has it that it is of British or European origin. The Eben, however, was created by an Edo artist. It is made of iron with an ivory bone handle and bronze. The Ada and fanlike Eben are ceremonial swords symbolizing the Oba’s kingship. All chiefs have the right to carry an Eben, while the Ada may have been a gift from the Europeans to Oba Ovonramwen.

### Oba Symbol

This bronze piece, created by an Edo artist, is essentially the symbol of a king, depicting the Oba in his full ceremonial attire.

### The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier

This cenotaph is in memory of our heroes who lost their lives during the two world wars and in the struggle to preserve Nigeria's territorial integrity as one nation.

## Personal Impressions

Personally, it was an interesting visit because I got to learn a lot about Benin history and the ancient city of Benin. The interior is beautiful, and the artifacts are well displayed. However, I noticed that although this place is a major tourist attraction in Benin, it is not being maintained properly. It still looks good now, but in a few years, it may not be the same.

## Visitor Information

Unfortunately, I’m not sure about their opening and closing hours, but I arrived at 1 pm and they were still open. As for expenses, if you're driving, you will need to pay ₦200 for parking and ₦500 for the tour. There is a restaurant and bar at the back of the gallery. I had heard there was a gift shop, but I didn’t see one during my visit.

## Conclusion

Overall, I can’t complain. The pros of my visit genuinely outweigh the cons by a huge margin. If you haven’t been, I highly recommend checking out the National Museum in Benin City.
