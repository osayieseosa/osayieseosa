## Introduction

The Nigerian economy is extremely harsh, and it is only going to get worse. This is the bitter truth that all Nigerian citizens are aware of. Due to this reality, many of us accept web development gigs with the sole aim of getting money to address immediate financial issues, without considering the long-term consequences. I recently found myself in this situation: I accepted a project without much thought, and all I can say is, it's something I will never do again.

## The Immediate Appeal of Accepting Any Project

I had just finished a project for a clientâ€”an e-commerce websiteâ€”and was feeling relieved and cheerful. The client had paid 50% upfront to start the project. However, when building websites, you often realize that customers delay payment of the remaining 50%, and I knew that I wasn't getting that money any time soon. My bank account was running really low, so I started searching for gigs on Nairaland but found absolutely nothing.

Fortunately, a referrer contacted me, letting me know that he had someone who urgently needed a website and had the money to pay. I asked what the client wanted to build, and he essentially said he wanted a cryptocurrency website like Binance or OctaFX. Up until that day, I had never traded or even used a platform like Binance, yet this guy wanted each customer to have a wallet and be able to make transactions.

After discussing the project, I realized that the client had no clear idea of what he wanted; he just wanted a sophisticated website to make money from. To make things worse, at this point, my exams were about to start. Despite all these red flags, I ignored them and accepted the deal for â‚¦160,000 to be completed in one month.

## The Hidden Cost of Poor Project Choices

After receiving the 50% payment, I felt really good about myself. I set up a new project on my laptop and began working, but then reality hit me. My initial idea was to build a site similar to Luno, where users with a particular cryptocurrency could find someone in need of that cryptocurrency, with a percentage fee going to the platform for each transaction.

This idea came to me after a week of research and brainstorming. The next challenge was figuring out how to create wallets on the site that could perform transactions. It took me about two weeks to solve that problem, leaving me with just one week to build the site. Without a proper project brief, I was essentially "winging it." Unsurprisingly, I failed miserably and had to come up with a story about needing an extra two weeks to work on it.

I was granted the two extra weeks, but the project was much more challenging than I initially thought. Websites involving transactions are generally the hardest to build because you can't afford to make any mistakes with people's assets. After much research, I stumbled upon a YouTube video that explained how to build a crypto escrow website, which was exactly what I needed.

I had to delete my initial code and rebuild the site based on the tutorial. Finally, I presented the website to the client after about two months. Just when I thought the worst was behind me, the client asked for a feature that wasn't part of the tutorial I followed, which took me another week to implement. I eventually got paid my remaining 50%.

You'd think that was the end of my struggles, right? Unfortunately, we had to schedule a call for me to explain the site to him. When I tested the website as a user, I realized there were so many bugs and errorsâ€”it was like nothing was working properly. Every time I fixed one issue, two more would appear. I eventually got so frustrated that I decided to rebuild the entire site from scratch. Three weeks later, I finally finished it, and it worked perfectly.

Looking back, I remember feeling so frustrated with all the errors and regretting why I went into web development in the first place. What was supposed to be a one-month project ended up taking almost three months. My reputation with the client was damaged due to my unprofessionalism, and I ended up spending over 10% of my earnings on data.

## Learning to Say No

If you come across a project that you have no idea how to build or if the amount being offered is not worth your time, it's best to let that project go. The excitement of quick cash might feel good initially, but that money won't last, while the stress from the project will.

## The Long-Term Benefits of Selectivity

Personally, when I work on projects I'm motivated to build from the start, I always deliver my best work. When you impress your clients with quality projects, they are more likely to refer you to other potential clients. More importantly, when you're mindful of the projects you accept, you come across as a more professional web developer.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, we're all hustlers, but nothing is more important than your personal well-being. It's crucial to be selective about the projects you accept, not just for the sake of comfort, but because, in the long run, this decision will be a key factor in building a fulfilling career.
