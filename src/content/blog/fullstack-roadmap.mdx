# Introduction

## Who is a Full Stack Web Developer?

A full stack developer is a professional who can create both front-end and back-end applications. They are capable of building a website from start to finish, handling everything from user interaction to server management and database operations. In essence, a full stack developer can create a fully functional website that manages user data and provides a seamless user experience.

## Why is a Roadmap Pivotal in 2024?

In today's rapidly growing tech industry, a plethora of content is constantly emerging, promising to be essential for becoming a web developer. This can create a toxic environment for beginners who may feel pressured to learn everything at once to stand out. This often leads to frustration and "tutorial hell." To avoid these pitfalls, following a well-structured roadmap is crucial. With the right roadmap, you can efficiently become a full stack developer in four months or less.

## Importance of Full Stack Skills in Nigeria

Starting out as a web developer in Nigeria, I strongly recommend learning full stack development. Whether you're aiming to work with foreign companies or local businesses, you will often need to build complete websites, especially if you plan to freelance. Nigerian businesses frequently request e-commerce websites, like Jumia ([https://jumia.com](https://jumia.com)), which require robust knowledge of both front-end and back-end technologies. 

In my experience, the first website I ever built was an e-commerce site. In Nigeria, employers and clients are less concerned with whether you specialize in front-end or back-end development; they simply want results. Hence, having full stack skills will make you more versatile and less likely to struggle in the local job market.

## Salary Insights

According to Glassdoor, web developers in Nigeria earn between NGN 88,000 to NGN 276,000 per month. A recent article from Albanny Technologies reports that the average salary ranges from NGN 80,000 to NGN 500,000 per month, with experienced developers in top companies earning up to NGN 1,000,000 per month. This information reflects the most accurate range for web developer salaries.

## Choosing the Right Tools

Selecting the right tools is crucial, especially for beginners. Opt for popular tools with large communities to ensure easier troubleshooting and support. Understanding the foundations with these tools will make it easier to learn new technologies over time.

### Front-End Development

For handling interactivity, styling, and structure of web pages, follow these steps:

### Back-End Development

For creating APIs and managing data, follow these steps:

step 1: Learn a Backend Framework based on your preferred language:
JavaScript: Node.js with Express (recommended), Deno

PHP: Laravel (recommended), or WordPress

Python: Django (recommended), Flask

Ruby: Rails (recommended)

step 2 Learn a Database:
NoSQL: MongoDB (recommended), Redis, Cassandra, DynamoDB

SQL: PostgreSQL (recommended), MySQL, SQLite

While there are additional topics to explore, such as Git and GitHub, the focus should be on understanding the basics and applying them through hands-on projects.

## My First Project

During my holidays, I built a website for my mom's chemist shop to track drug prices and inventory. This project taught me the fundamentals of web development and highlighted that real learning comes from practical experience rather than just tutorials.

## Meta Frameworks

Meta frameworks enhance core frameworks and are useful for newer projects. While optional, they can improve job prospects. For example, I use Next.js for full stack applications due to its speed and advanced features. Other meta frameworks include:

- _React:_ Next.js, Remix
- _Svelte:_ SvelteKit
- _Vue:_ Nuxt.js

Additional topics to explore include version control, JSON, regular expressions, deployment, basic security (e.g., JWT), authentication, and testing (e.g., Jest or Vitest).

# Conclusion

I remember struggling with imposter syndrome and feeling lost in my journey as a web developer. However, with the guidance of this roadmap, I really hope your journey will be alot more straightfoward.
