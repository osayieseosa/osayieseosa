## Introduction

One thing I can say is that landing your first web development client will take a lot of patience, persistence, and effort, and in a lot of cases, it will leave you questioning if web development is for you. But once you get that first client, the process becomes a lot clearer.

## My Initial Findings

If you google ‚Äúhow to get web development clients,‚Äù you are going to find a lot of advice‚Äîfrom using freelancing platforms to social media and more. I initially found steps online that I thought were amazing, which were:

1. Build a website to ensure I understand everything I had learned.
2. Build a website for a business for free.
3. Build a portfolio to showcase your work, and referrals from those projects would get me clients.

## Building a Website for Free

This particular aspect is something that should be approached with caution. People always mention never to work for free. From my own experience, this is true but only to an extent; as a newbie, this doesn‚Äôt apply to you.

People also say you need to build for free so they can refer you and help grow your business. From my experience, I genuinely have never noticed how working for free helped me get referrals, but others might have experiences that say otherwise. Initially, I believed this would help with referrals, so I built a website for my friend's shawarma spot, hoping to get referrals. I slowly started realizing something eye-opening. Now pay close attention and remember this: ‚ÄúBuilding websites for free did not get me referrals; rather, it got me projects to present to potential employers.‚Äù

You are probably confused, so let me explain this. After I built the website for my friend, I realized that I started getting what we call ‚Äúwindow shoppers‚Äù‚Äîessentially clients that just contact you for inquiries and nothing more; they never make a single purchase. After a web developer friend of mine got a client from Nairaland, I posted my skills on Nairaland and also started getting serious clients ‚Äúcontacting‚Äù me.

Now, what you will notice with this story is that I mentioned that people started to ‚Äúcontact‚Äù me, not hire me.

Even though they had the money to pay, what I quickly realized was that nobody is just going to hand you an important project to work on. They ask for projects you have worked on before and your tech stack, then in some cases, they ask for your portfolio website. You should see how important that free website becomes.

So, what I am saying is that building a website for free didn‚Äôt give me referrals but rather gave me projects that I could showcase to potential employers.

## How to Charge Properly

This is a question everybody asks when starting out, and as a newbie, I always advise not focusing on money. I don‚Äôt know about you, but when I started, people around me told me stories about how much people make from web development. Honestly, because I wanted to cash out like those people, I ended up losing a serious customer.

Look at Oraimo. This was a business that started out with a simple strategy‚Äîquality products for affordable prices. Little by little, they have been increasing their prices. What they did initially was build themselves a brand, and now they have taken over the accessory market in Nigeria. My personal advice is to start out building websites for about 60 ‚Äì 100k, then little by little increase your price. I built my first website for 70k, but this is all relative to the client, so nor go use 70k build website for foreign company ooh, I go only laugh you.

## My Advice for Beginners

Getting your first web development client isn‚Äôt easy. I am being 100% honest when I say there was a point when I almost quit web development because I couldn‚Äôt get a single client. But just keep on improving your skills, remain patient and persistent, and if you see others getting tons of clients, remember to stay positive and celebrate them, so when it is your turn, they will celebrate you.

## Conclusion

If you are in a situation where you are having difficulty getting that client, please know that everything is going as planned; you just have to keep going.
